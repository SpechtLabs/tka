  models.TkaClusterInfo:
    description: Contains cluster information including API endpoint, CA data, TLS
      settings, and identifying labels
    properties:
      ca_data:
        description: |-
          CAData contains the base64-encoded Certificate Authority (CA) data for the Kubernetes cluster.
          This is used to verify the TLS certificate presented by the API server.
          The data should be the PEM-encoded CA certificate, encoded as base64.
          If empty and InsecureSkipTLSVerify is false, the system's root CA bundle will be used.
        type: string
      insecure_skip_tls_verify:
        description: |-
          InsecureSkipTLSVerify controls whether TLS certificate verification should be skipped when connecting to the cluster.
          When true, the client will accept any certificate presented by the server and any hostname matching errors.
          This should only be set to true for development/testing environments with self-signed certificates.
          Production clusters should use valid certificates and keep this false for security.
        type: boolean
      labels:
        additionalProperties:
          type: string
        description: |-
          Labels is a set of key-value pairs that can be used to identify and categorize the cluster.
          These labels help users distinguish between different clusters and can be used for
          automation, monitoring, or organizational purposes.
          Common examples: environment (dev/staging/prod), region, project, team ownership, etc.
        type: object
      server_url:
        description: |-
          ServerURL is the public Kubernetes API server URL or IP address that users should connect to.
          This should be the externally accessible endpoint of the cluster's API server.
          Example: "https://api.cluster.example.com:6443" or "https://192.168.1.100:6443"
